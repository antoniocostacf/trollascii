15,01                What exactly does being a courier mean?

15,01        Here at ACiD Productions,  we produce many pieces of art-
15,01 work,  and are the most productive  of all the other  groups.  A
15,01 courier  has  the responsibility of picking up a  newly  created
15,01 ANSi  (or any other artwork or file),  and delivering it to sev-
15,01 eral  BBSs  that he is assigned to.  He would need  to  keep  in
15,01 contact  with these BBSes, probably calling every other day,  or
15,01 more often, if necessary.  Information on the release of new art
15,01 is acquired by calling the ACiD Courier VMB,  maintaining a link
15,01 with the Courier Coordinator,  The Gray Ranger.  In other words,
15,01 what this all means is that a  courier  will be one of the first
15,01 people to view the newest  art in the world,  and he has the re-
15,01 sponsibility of  distributing  this  art  across the nation.  We
15,01 demand nothing less than excellence,  so only the very best need
15,01 apply.
