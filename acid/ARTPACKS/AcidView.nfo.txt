15,01Introduction.

15,01        This is Acid View for Java.  It is a platform independant file-viewer.
15,01This means you can run this on Windows 95, X windows, MacOs, practically
15,01any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

15,01:NOTICE:  This is a Java application, not an applet.  This has nothing
15,01to do with the web at all.  This runs stand-alone, just like any other
15,01program you own.


15,01Obtaining a JVM.

15,01        You don't have a program to run java applcations?  You can get one
15,01from several locations.  Microsoft has one.  There is a freeware one
15,01(the one I used to develop this applcation) called the Java Development
15,01Kit (JDK) from Sun.  You can get the SunOs and Windows 95 versions of JDK
15,01from java.sun.com.  You can get the Linux version from www.blackdown.org.


15,01Running Acid View for Java.

15,01        I have included 2 shell routines to run Acid View.  Both require
15,01that your JVM is called "java".  The first is called avj, and is for unix
15,01systems.  The second is called avj.bat, and is for Windows 95/NT.  To
15,01run just type "avj" at the prompt.


15,01What Can It View?

15,01        As of now (version 5.0b)  Acid View can view ANSIs, ASCIIs, GIFs,
15,01JPEGS, XBINs, and any text file you happen to have.  The line length for
15,01textfiles and ANSIs is limited to 400 lines, however this will be changed
15,01soon.  And for XBINs it's 1000 lines.


15,01Where will it go from here?

15,01        I'm not sure.  I want to speed up the ansi displaying routines.
15,01SAUCE support will be added soon.  I will recode it using JDK1.1.1 as soon
15,01as I get my hands on a Linux version.  Hopefully it will run a little faster.
