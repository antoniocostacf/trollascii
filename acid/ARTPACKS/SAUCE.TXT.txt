15,01     --------
15,01     For all graphics types, TInfo1 holds width of the image, TInfo2
15,01     holds the Height of the image and TInfo3 holds the number of bits
15,01     per pixel (a 256 colour image would have 8 bits per pixel, a
15,01     TrueColor image would have 24);

15,01     FLAGSiversal process to incorporate  a  full description for any

15,01     BinaryText
15,01     ----------
15,01     The Binary Text format, basically has no Filetype, since the datatype!!
15,01     has already defined how the file will look.t for ID, Version, FileSize,
15,01     The FileType however specifies the WIDTH of the BinaryText screen.
15,01     Only the Width is required, as the Height can be calculated by dividing
15,01     the filesize by the Width.
15,01     In an attempt to provide as much WIDTH as possible in a possible 256
