15,01Rocket here, bringing you a little source code to help you get started trying
15,01to write your own VESA Super VGA code.  Certain VESA SVGA cards require you
15,01to load the driver from the manufacturer for these routines to work.  If you
15,01think you have a VESA SVGA card, but get an error message, try loading the
15,01driver.  I realize this code does not include the bank switching routines
15,01(can't give everything away) but it should be enough to get you started
15,01SVGA loaders.
