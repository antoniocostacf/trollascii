| | |This is the original and unmodified loplpackit, revision 6 by UThere. | | | |
| | |Although I can't enforce it I'm asking major sites for limited        |-| | |
| | |distribution of this release due the dangerous nature of this code;   ||| | |
| | |major ISPs and networks have already been taken down through seemingly||| | |
| | |endless loplpackits and hienamis. Just don't get it into the wrong    |-| | |
| | |hands (blaming UThere is fine too, as long as it sounds credible.)    | | | |
| | |                                                                      |-| | |
| | | Version: rev6 build420 (maintainer: UThere)                          ||| | |
| | |                                                                      ||| | |
| | |Let this be a lesson to UThere that being secretive                   |-| | |
| | |is NOT always the best way to do things. ;]  -D.                      | | | |
